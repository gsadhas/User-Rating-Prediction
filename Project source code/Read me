SVM and RF algorithms
---------------------

1. Place .csv file in “data” folder
2. Navigate to SVM and RF folder in terminal
3. main.py is the file that runs the code
4. Run the source code using below command from the terminal

	python main.py

NOTE: To run individual models, comment and uncomment respective models and features. 
Please use one “combined_features” and “rf”

#Baseline model 1
combined_features = FeatureUnion([("tfidf", vectorizer)])

#Baseline model 2
combined_features = FeatureUnion([("sentiment", senti)])

#Baseline model 3
combined_features = FeatureUnion([("LDA", lda)])

# Combined model
combined_features = FeatureUnion([("tfidf", vectorizer), ("sentiment", senti), ("LDA", lda)])

# SVM
rf = svm.SVC(class_weight="balanced", kernel="linear", gamma="auto")

# Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, n_jobs=2)



Convolution algorithms
----------------------
1. Features were extracted from sample dataset and convered into numpy array.
2. Features dump are in data folder.
3. To run the code, navigate NNcode folder in terminal
4. Run below files for respective algorithms using below command

	For CNN model 1,
					python convnet1.py

	For CNN model 2,
					python convent2.py
